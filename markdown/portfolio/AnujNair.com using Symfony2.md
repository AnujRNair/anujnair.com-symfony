# AnujNair.com using Symfony2

AnujNair.com was developed using symfony2 as a means for me to learn more about the framework.

It consists of:

* **A Blog** allowing me to share my thoughts and findings
* **A Portfolio** so I can show my work to the world
* **An About** and **Contact** page so everyone can learn more about me and contact me if needed

AnujNair.com utilizes the following languages and technologies:

* PHP
* Symfony2
* MySQL and PDO
* Doctrine
* CSS and LESS
* HTML5
* Twig
* Composer
* NPM
* Bower

It's a continued work in progress!
