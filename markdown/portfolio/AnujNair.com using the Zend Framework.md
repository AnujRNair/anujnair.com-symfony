# AnujNair.com using the Zend Framework

AnujNair.com originally used the Zend Framework, and was developed to allow me to learn more about the framework. This legacy site has been replaced by the symfony versiojn of my site, however the code is still viewable on my GitHub page.

It acted as a place for me to share my thoughts through my blog, share my work with everyone through my portfolio, share links to other interesting programming sites I had found, and allow people to learn more about me and contact me.

AnujNair.com using the ZendFramework utilised:

* PHP
* Zend Framework
* MySQL and PDO
* CSS
* xHTML
