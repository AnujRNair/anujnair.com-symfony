# Webpack After Chunk Hash Plugin

Webpack After Chunk Hash Plugin is a webpack plugin designed to rename chunks to incorporate their true hashes, after the chunks have been emitted, regardless of their import order, or any other non deterministic state.

The problem it is trying to solve can be found detailed out in the [readme](https://github.com/AnujRNair/webpack-after-chunk-hash-plugin#webpack-after-chunk-hash-plugin) file of its GitHub repository.
